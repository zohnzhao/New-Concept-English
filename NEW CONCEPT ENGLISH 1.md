# Lesson 129 Seventy miles an hour

Look,Gary!That policeman's waving to you.He wants you to stop.

Where do you think you are?On a race track?You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.

I can't have been.

I was doing eighty when I overtook you.

Didn't you see the speed limit?

I'm afraid I didn't,officer.I must have been dreaming.

He wasn't dreaming,officer.I was telling him to drive slowly.

That's why I didn't see the sign.

Let me see your driving licence.

I won't charge you this time.But you'd better not do it again!

Thank you.I'll certainly be more careful.

I told you to drive slowly,Gary.

You always tell me to drive slowly,darling.

Well,next time you'd better take my advice!

# Lesson 143 A walk through the woods

I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods.It is a famous beauty spot.On Sundays,hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods.Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy.Litter baskets have been placed under the trees,but people still throw their rubbish everywhere.Last Wednesday,I went for a walk in the woods.What I saw made me very sad.I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators.The litter baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper,cigarette ends,old tyres,empty bottles and rusty tins.Among the rubbish,I found a sign which said,'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosevuted!'
